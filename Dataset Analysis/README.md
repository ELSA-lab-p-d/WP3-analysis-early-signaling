# Dataset Analysis: WP3 Early-Warning System

## Overview

This folder contains analytical notebooks and code developed as part of **Work Package 3 (WP3): Early Warning** for debt prevention at Dutch municipalities. The analyses assess the effectiveness of current early-warning approaches in identifying and addressing household debt signals.

## Purpose

The work aims to evaluate how early-warning systems operate in practice by examining:

- **Signal handling effectiveness**: How municipalities detect and respond to debt warning signals
- **Contact success rates**: Patterns in successful engagement with households across different contexts
- **Temporal and geographic variations**: How outcomes differ across time periods and municipalities
- **Population characteristics**: The relationship between demographic factors and intervention success

## Analytical Approach

Using statistical and descriptive methods, these analyses provide evidence-based insights into the performance of existing early-signaling methods. The work establishes a consistent analytical framework for:

1. Evaluating current intervention strategies
2. Comparing outcomes across municipalities
3. Supporting evidence-based policy recommendations
4. Enabling future research within the WP3 framework

## Folder Structure

- **2024/**: Deliverable of 2024 containing initial debt analysis and exploratory data work
- **2025/**: Deliverable of 2025 with extended analysis and advanced methodology

Each year's subfolder contains its own detailed documentation explaining the specific analyses performed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Running the Analysis

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook** in this directory:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Select a notebook** (e.g., `2025/ELSA_3.2.ipynb`) and open it

3. **Add your data** to the appropriate folder and update any file paths in the notebook

4. **Run the notebook** by clicking "Run All" or press `Shift + Enter` to run cells one by one

That's it! The notebook will generate all outputs and visualizations automatically.

### Data Requirements

The notebooks expect properly formatted municipal debt signal data. Ensure your dataset includes:
- Temporal information (dates/timestamps)
- Municipal identifiers
- Signal types and outcomes
- Contact attempt records
- Relevant demographic information (where applicable)

Refer to individual notebook documentation for specific data schema requirements.
