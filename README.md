# WP3 analysis early signaling

This repository will contain the actual code to perform the analysis for early signaling insights. The model card, being used during development to describe the ELSA aspects is available at [model_card.md](model_card.md). This model card was derived from [huggingface model card template](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/src/huggingface_hub/templates/modelcard_template.md) and based on the work of Mitchell et. al.
