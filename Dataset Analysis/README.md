#WP3 Early-Warning Analysis

This repository contains analytical code and notebooks developed within WP3: Early Warning / Early Signalling. The work focuses on analysing data from municipalities to assess the effectiveness of the current early-warning approach for debt prevention.

Using statistical and descriptive analyses, the repository examines how early-warning signals are acted upon in practice and how outcomes such as successful contact and engagement vary across time, municipalities, and population characteristics. The analyses are intended to support evaluation of existing early-signalling methods and to provide a consistent analytical basis for comparison and further development within the WP3 framework.
