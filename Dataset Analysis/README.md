# WP3 Early-Warning Analysis

This repository contains analytical work on data collected within **WP3: Early Warning / Early Signalling**. The analyses apply statistical and descriptive methods to explore patterns and variation in outreach and engagement outcomes following early-warning signals.

The codebase is designed to be compatible with datasets from different reporting years and sources, providing a consistent and transparent approach to examining how signals are followed up, how individuals respond to outreach, and how outcomes vary over time, across municipalities, and between population groups. The repository is intended to support monitoring, comparison, and further research within the WP3 framework.
