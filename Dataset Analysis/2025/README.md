# 2025 Deliverable: Expanded Early-Warning Analysis

## Overview

This folder contains the 2025 deliverable for WP3, featuring an expanded analysis of municipal early-warning outreach data for debt prevention interventions. The analysis examines key outcomes including successful contact rates and help acceptance patterns.

## What's New in 2025

This year's analysis significantly extends the 2024 work with **seven additional analytical experiments** that provide deeper insights:

- **Temporal patterns**: How outreach performance changes over time
- **Municipal variation**: Differences in effectiveness across municipalities
- **Population segmentation**: Outcome patterns across demographic groups
- **Behavioral outcomes**: Analysis of engagement and response patterns
- **Statistical associations**: Identifying significant relationships and predictors
