# Expanded Analysis of Early-Warning Outreach Outcomes

This notebook presents an exploratory and descriptive analysis of municipal early-warning outreach data related to debt interventions. The analysis focuses on key outreach outcomes, including successful contact and help acceptance.

In this version, the analysis has been substantially expanded and refined through the introduction of a set of new, in-depth analytical components. The notebook implements seven additional experiments that examine outreach performance from multiple perspectives, including temporal patterns, municipal variation, population segmentation, behavioural outcomes, and statistical associations. Together, these extensions provide a more comprehensive and structured assessment of the early-warning outreach process.

All analyses are implemented using transparent, reproducible code and are intended to support systematic monitoring and further evaluation of early-warning outreach practices.
