# WP3 Early-Warning Analysis

This repository contains analytical code and notebooks developed within **WP3: Early Warning**. The work focuses on analysing data from municipalities to assess the effectiveness of the **current early-warning approach for debt prevention**.

Using statistical and descriptive analyses, the repository examines how early-warning signals are handled in practice and how outcomes such as successful contact and engagement vary across time, municipalities, and population characteristics. The analyses support the evaluation of existing early-signalling methods and provide a consistent analytical basis for comparison and further research within the WP3 framework.
